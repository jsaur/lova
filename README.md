# Lova

This is a hackathon project for Kiva-style crowd-funded microloans on the Celo blockchain.

## Getting Started

You need to have Node (Node.js v12.x), NPM and yarn installed.

The scaffolding is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First install the dependencies with:
```bash
yarn
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

To interact with the Celo blockchain you will need a Celo wallet. For simplicity of dev development we recommend the Celo Extension Wallet for Chome (works on Brave too)

## TODO

Right now the webapp just displays a button to connect Celo wallet
